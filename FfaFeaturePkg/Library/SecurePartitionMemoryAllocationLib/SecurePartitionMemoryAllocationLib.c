/**
  Reallocates a buffer of type EfiRuntimeServicesData.

  Allocates and zeros the number bytes specified by NewSize from memory of type
  EfiRuntimeServicesData.  If OldBuffer is not NULL, then the smaller of OldSize and
  NewSize bytes are copied from OldBuffer to the newly allocated buffer, and
  OldBuffer is freed.  A pointer to the newly allocated buffer is returned.
  If NewSize is 0, then a valid buffer of 0 size is  returned.  If there is not
  enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.

  If the allocation of the new buffer is successful and the smaller of NewSize and OldSize
  is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - OldBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  OldSize        The size, in bytes, of OldBuffer.
  @param  NewSize        The size, in bytes, of the buffer to reallocate.
  @param  OldBuffer      The buffer to copy to the allocated buffer.  This is an optional
                         parameter that may be NULL.

  @return A pointer to the allocated buffer or NULL if allocation fails.
